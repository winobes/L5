- the setting is in space, but feels more like a fantasy rpg in some ways
- areas of dense colinization (limnation points, resource-rich asteroid fields,
  planetary/lunar setelments, etc.) are like towns
- modules of the space stations are like buildings
- some modules may be connected by piences that are part of the background
  like buildings might be conneceted by a road in a terrestrial RPG
- inside towns are safe zones -- no fighting
- except in arenas! major "cities" have these arenas
- far enough outside towns is the wilderness

There are four clusters of human habitation in the solarsystem:
  - The Earth 
    - blocky ships
    - white, brown
  - Venus
    - eliptical shapes and accute angles
    - yellow, green
  - Mars
    - purple, blue
  - Jupiter
    - pentagonal ships large surface area
    - red, orange


Jovian System

2100 - first scientific communites (very few on Europa)
2157 - first commercial colonists 
2157 - mining boom begins
2160 - provincial goverment established by COSOCA (The Comercial Outer Space 
       Operations Controling Authority)
2203 - the two corporations with the largest stakes in Jovian enterprise
       leave COSOCA
2207 - Jovian provincial authority officially declares independence from
       COSOCA
2210 - negligent practices on Iio cause the deaths of 3200 colonists
2211 - 2230 - colonist rebellions, aided by inner system powers
2230 - mininig corporations regain control, take over governance
2300 - mining boom ends Jovian corporations are taken over, larger companies
       with stakes in Jupiter pull out
2307 - colonists rebel, install populist government

Jupiter has many moons and smaller satelites rich in resources. The first
colonists arived in the Jovian system around 200 years ago, beginning a mining
boom that lasted several generations. In the year 
During the previous centrury, the Jovian 
economy has been in a deep depression, leaving many inhabitants severely 
impoverished. In the last ten years, renewed interest in Jovian minerals 
(spurred by the Venitian construction boom) has brought new 

The gas giant emits an intense field of radiation, which may explain the high 
frequency of psionic abilities among Jovian natives.

- Each ship has mount points
- possible mounts include
  - weapons 
  - enhanced sensors
  - enhanced shields
- Weapons may be either blasters (magic), missiles (ranged) or  mele (like a lance
  laser or electric arc or even physical sword-like things).
- Mountpoints may be fixed or rotate (follow the mouse).
- The angle of fixed mountpoints is determined by the ship (not necessairly 
  straight forward) maybe it can be determined by the player in some cases.

- weapons have different damage types
- this is a vector of two things (pierce/bludgeon and energy/physical)
- firing missiles 

- crew have skills that can be trained
- skills include
  - weapons (missiles, blasters, mele) <- possbily  each a separate skill
    - do more damage or possibly pennetrate armour/shields better depending on
      how all that works
    - can use better weapons (like attack in runescape)
  - engines 
    - recover faster from "running" like agility in runescape
    - use less fuel
  - piloting
    - go faster
    - makes the ship more maneuverable (rotate faster, stop faster)
  - shields
    - shields recover faster
    - higher maximum shield health
  - damage control
    - recover hull hp faster
  - maybe also exclusively non-combat skills like crafting (ship parts, missiles)
    and mining (asteroids)
- when your ship is destroyed, your crew is returned (via escape pod or some
  shit) to L5, you get a free shitty ship in the beginning from some sketchy guy
- the number of crew you can have depends on the ship. extra crew are left at a
  station and you can pick them up there again later
- somehow balance it so that it's good to have crew have specialties (skill wise)
  but also good to have balance
  - maybe leveling up gets more difficult with total level (as opposed to 
    individual levels) so a level 1 pilot with level 9 engineering must work just
    as hard to get to level 2 pilot as a level 10 pilot getting to level 11
- trading crew members
