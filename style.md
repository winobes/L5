Here I will keep a list of the conventions that I'm loosing so that I don't loose track. Generally I'll follow the linux kernel style with som exceptions.

# Spacing #

- Two empty lines between functions
- One empty line after function declaration and before the final brace
- Inside functions, one empty line can be inserted between blocks of code for readability.
- Tabs are four spaces


# Headers #

- ever .c file should have a header file excetp for main.c
- header declare only functions and macros that they need to export


-
